Ingredients for Teriyaki Meatballs
Pineapple chunks: Canned pineapple is a convenient pantry staple; you’ll add the juice to the meatballs and use the pineapple chunks for serving!
Onion, yellow pepper and red pepper: Chopped veggies contribute color and flavor to your meatballs and help to keep them moist.
Dry breadcrumbs: These are essential for binding the meatball ingredients so that they hold their shape when baked.
Ground ginger: Ground ginger adds flavor and a mild “kick” to the meatballs and sauce.
Ground beef: Lean ground beef cooks quickly, and is ideal for meatballs as it holds its shape better than fattier cuts.
Soy Sauce: Soy sauce is a key ingredient to this recipe’s sauce, providing that distinctive umami flavor.
Honey: Honey adds a gentle sweetness to the teriyaki meatball sauce.
Vinegar: Vinegar adds flavor and an acidity that complements the other ingredients and helps cut through some of the richness.
Garlic powder: Convenient and ready to use, garlic powder is a more subtle and concentrated alternative to fresh garlic.
